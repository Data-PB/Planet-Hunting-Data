# Planet-Hunting-Data

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system. To help process this data, created machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

### Preprocess the Data

* Preprocessed the dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Performed feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Used `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separated the data into training and testing data.

### Tune Model Parameters

* Used `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tuned and compared at least two different classifiers.
